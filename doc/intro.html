<h1>Request Flow Graph Visualization</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The request flow graph visualizer is a tool for visualizing the request flow differences output by <a href="http://www.usenix.org/event/nsdi11/tech/slides/sambasivan.pdf" target="_blank">Spectroscope</a>. 
</p>

<h2>Operation</h2>
<p>This tool takes as input a collection of graph clusters generated from end-to-end traces in <a href="www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html" target="_blank">dot</a> format. The Spectroscope Cluster IDs and metadata are used to identify precursor-mutation pairs, which are compiled into a JSON index. The dot graphs themselves are also lexed into JSON, and are then loaded with XHR into the visualization page. This page performs parsing, graph differencing and styling, and displays the precursor-mutation difference pairs with the help of the <a href="http://thejit.org/" target="_blank">JIT</a> library.
</p>

<h2>Generating Graphs</h2>
<p>To use your own graphs as input to the tool, conversion scripts are available in the <tt>graphs</tt> directory. The tools use graphs in <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html">DOT</a> format as input - in particular, those generated by Spectroscope as described in the <a href="https://github.com/RS1999ent/spectroscope/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">Spectroscope documentation</a>.</p>

<h3>Using the Pipeline</h3>
<p>To use the conversion pipeline as-is, you will need <tt>weighted_combined_ranked_graphs.dot</tt> and <tt>originating_clusters.dot</tt>. First run <tt>extract.py originating_clusters.dot <i>outdir</i></tt>, where <tt><i>outdir</i></tt> is the desired output directory for graphs (examples of successful output are in <tt>graphs/*/out</tt> of this source tree). Then, run <tt>extract.py weighted_combined_ranked_graphs.dot <i>outdir</i></tt>, which will generate an index of precursor-mutation pairs; the UI currently loads the pair with the highest cost value.</p>

<p>To obtain proper timing information on graph edges directly from Spectroscope output, there is a required preprocessing step; run <tt>fixup.py</tt> targeting a directory with <tt>weighted_combined_ranked_graphs.dot</tt> and <tt>originating_clusters.dot</tt> (run this after <tt>extract.py</tt>)</p>

<h3>Graph Format</h3>
<p>Some (very) experimental code for generating input from graphs in <a href="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/" target="_blank">GraphML</a> format is available in <tt>graphs/test/yed</tt>. If you are interested in writing your own converter or converting from a custom format, the graph input format is a folder containing <tt>index.json</tt> and a set of files <tt><i>name</i>.json</tt>, where <tt>index.json</tt> has the form:</p>
<pre>
[
	{ "id":1,"precursor":2, "cost":9999, "type":"Structural mutation" },
	{ "id":3,"precursor":4, "cost":8888, "type":"Response time change" },
	...
]
</pre>
<p>where the graph in <tt>2.json</tt> is the precursor for the graph in <tt>1.json</tt>, has cost 9999, and is a structural mutation. Each graph has format:</p>
<pre>
{
	"nodes": 
	[
	{ "id":"1", ... },
	{ "id":"id_from", "label":"e10__t3__nodename_from" },
	{ "id":"id_to", "label":"e10__t3__nodename_to" }
	],
	"edges":
	[
	{ "from":"id_from", "to":"id_to", "color":"black", "label":"... 23us ... 50us ..." }
	]
}
</pre>
<p>
The node with id 1 is special, and contains graph metadata (not used in the basic visualization). Each other node has a unique ID (e.g., <tt>id_from</tt>), and a label with format <tt>e<i>machineID</i>__t<i>threadID</i>__<i>label</i></tt>. Nodes are colored by their <tt><i>machineID</i></tt>, and will contain text <tt><i>label</i></tt>. In the example above, the only  edge connects the two nodes. Timing information is parsed from the label property: the first match of <i>number</i>us in the precursor graph file will be the edge time (used for length) for the precursor, and the second match of <i>number</i>us in the mutation graph file will be the edge time for the mutation. As an aside, graphs do not need to be strict JSON - for historical reasons, they are eval'ed.
</p>

<h3>Registering Graphs</h3>
<p>
To register graphs with the UI, place the resulting graph files in <tt>graphs/<b>&lt;name&gt;</b>/out</tt>, where <tt><b>&lt;name&gt;</b></tt> is folder of your choice. The existing sibling directories provide examples of this structure. Then, in <tt>index.html</tt>, add <tt><b>&lt;name&gt;</b></tt> to <tt>Tasks.ALL = ["training", <tt><b>&lt;name&gt;</b></tt>, </tt>...</tt>
</p>

<h2>Code Documentation</h2>
<p>Documentation for the javascript and visualization components are available in the <a href="gen/index.html" target="mainfr">jsdoc</a> (also linked on the left). Formatted js code is also there under "File Index."

<h1>Request Flow Graph Visualization</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The request flow graph visualizer is a tool for visualizing the request flow differences output by <a href="http://www.usenix.org/event/nsdi11/tech/slides/sambasivan.pdf" target="_blank">Spectroscope</a>. 
</p>

<h2>Operation</h2>
<p>This tool takes as input a collection of graph clusters generated from end-to-end traces in <a href="www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html" target="_blank">dot</a> format. The Spectroscope Cluster IDs and metadata are used to identify precursor-mutation pairs, which are compiled into a JSON index. The dot graphs themselves are also lexed into JSON, and are then loaded with XHR into the visualization page. This page performs parsing, graph differencing and styling, and displays the precursor-mutation difference pairs with the help of the <a href="http://thejit.org/" target="_blank">JIT</a> library.
</p>

<h2>Generating Graphs</h2>
<p>To use your own graphs as input to the tool, conversion scripts are available in the <tt>graphs</tt> directory. The tools use graphs in <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html">DOT</a> format as input - in particular, those generated by Spectroscope as described in the <a href="https://github.com/RS1999ent/spectroscope/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">Spectroscope documentation</a>.</p>

<p>To use the conversion pipeline as-is, you will need <tt>weighted_combined_ranked_graphs.dot</tt> and <tt>originating_clusters.dot</tt>. First run <tt>extract.py originating_clusters.dot <i>outdir</i></tt>, where <tt><i>outdir</i></tt> is the desired output directory for graphs (examples of successful output are in <tt>graphs/*/out</tt> of this source tree). Then, run <tt>extract.py weighted_combined_ranked_graphs.dot <i>outdir</i></tt>, which will generate an index of precursor-mutation pairs; the UI currently loads the pair with the highest cost value.</p>

<p>To obtain proper timing information on graph edges directly from Spectroscope output, there is a required preprocessing step; run <tt>fixup.py</tt> targeting a directory with <tt>weighted_combined_ranked_graphs.dot</tt> and <tt>originating_clusters.dot</tt>.</p>

<p>Some (very) experimental code for generating input from graphs in <a href="http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/" target="_blank">GraphML</a> format is available in <tt>graphs/test/yed</tt>.</p>

<h2>Code Documentation</h2>
<p>Documentation for the javascript and visualization components are available in the <a href="gen/index.html" target="mainfr">jsdoc</a> (also linked on the left). Formatted js code is also there under "File Index."

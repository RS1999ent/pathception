<h1>Request Flow Graph Visualization</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The request flow graph visualizer is a tool for visualizing the request flow differences output by <a href="http://www.usenix.org/event/nsdi11/tech/slides/sambasivan.pdf" target="_blank">Spectroscope</a>. 
</p>

<h2>Operation</h2>
<p>This tool takes as input a collection of graph clusters generated from end-to-end traces in <a href="www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html" target="_blank">dot</a> format. The Spectroscope Cluster IDs and metadata are used to identify precursor-mutation pairs, which are compiled into a JSON index. The dot graphs themselves are also lexed into JSON, and are then loaded with XHR into the visualization page. This page performs parsing, graph differencing and styling, and displays the precursor-mutation difference pairs with the help of the <a href="http://thejit.org/" target="_blank">JIT</a> library.
</p>

<h2>Code Documentation</h2>
<p>Documentation for the javascript and visualization components are available in the <a href="gen/index.html" target="mainfr">jsdoc</a> (also linked on the left). Formatted js code is also there under "File Index."
